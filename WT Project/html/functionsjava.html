    <h1> Java methods </h1>
    <p>The method in Java or Methods of Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific tasks and return the result to the caller. A Java method can perform some specific tasks without returning anything. Java Methods allows us to reuse the code without retyping the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class that is different from languages like C, C++, and Python. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A method is like a function i.e. used to expose the behaviour of an object </li>
        <li> It is a set of codes that perform a particular task </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Syntax of Method </h2>
    <p> &lt;access_modifier&gt; &ltreturn_type&gt; &ltmethod_name&gt( list_of_parameters)</br>{</br>&emsp;//body </br> } </p>
    <h2> Advantage of Method </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Code Reusability</li>
        <li>Code Optimization</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Method declaration </h2>

    <h2>Types of Method in Java</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Predefined method</li>
        <p>In Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as the standard library method or built-in method. We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any point</p>
        <li>User-defined method</li>
        <p>The method written by the user or programmer is known as a user-defined method. These methods are modified according to the requirement.</p>
    </ol>
    <h2> Naming a method </h2>
    <p>A method name is typically a single word that should be a verb in lowercase or a multi-word, that begins with a verb in lowercase followed by an adjective, noun. After the first word, the first letter of each word should be capitalized.</p>
    <h3>Rules to name a method: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While defining a method, remember that the method name must be a verb and start with a lowercase letter.</li>
        <li>If the method name has more than two words, the first name must be a verb followed by an adjective or noun.</li>
        <li>In the multi-word method name, the first letter of each word must be in uppercase except the first word. For example, findSum, computeMax, setX, and getX.</li>
    </ul>
