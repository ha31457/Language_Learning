    <h1> Functions in C++ </h1>
    <p> A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.
        In simple terms, a function is a block of code that runs only when it is called </p>

    <h1> Why Do We Need Functions? </h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Functions help us in reducing code redundancy. If functionality is performed at multiple places in software, then rather than writing the same code, again and again, we create a function and call it everywhere. This also helps in maintenance as we have to make changes in only one place if we make changes to the functionality in future. </li>
        <li> Functions make code modular. Consider a big file having many lines of code. It becomes really simple to read and use the code,  if the code is divided into functions. </li>
        <li> Functions provide abstraction. For example, we can use library functions without worrying about their internal work. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Function Declaration </h1>
    <p> A function declaration tells the compiler about the number of parameters, data types of parameters, and returns type of function. Writing parameter names in the function declaration is optional but it is necessary to put them in the definition. Below is an example of function declarations. (parameter names are not present in the below declarations) </p>

    <h1> There are two types of functions : </h1>
    <h2> 1. User defined functions </h2>
    <h2> 2. Library functions </h2>
    <h1>1. User defined functions </h1>
    <p> User-defined functions are user/customer-defined blocks of code specially customized to reduce the complexity of big programs. They are also commonly known as “tailor-made functions” which are built only to satisfy the condition in which the user is facing issues meanwhile reducing the complexity of the whole program. </p>
    <h1> 2. Library functions </h1>
    <p> Library functions are also called “built-in Functions“. These functions are part of a compiler package that is already defined and consists of a special function with special and different meanings. Built-in Function gives us an edge as we can directly use them without defining them whereas in the user-defined function we have to declare and define a function before using them. </p>
    <h1> Points to remember about functions in C++ </h1>
    <ul> 
        <li> Most C++ program has a function called main() that is called by the operating system when a user runs the program </li>
        <li> Every function has a return type. If a function doesn’t return any value, then void is used as a return type. Moreover, if the return type of the function is void, we still can use the return statement in the body of the function definition by not specifying any constant, variable, etc. with it, by only mentioning the ‘return;’ statement which would symbolize the termination of the function </li>
    </ul>
