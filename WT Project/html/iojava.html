    <h1> Java IO : Input-output in Java </h1>
    <p>Java brings various Streams with its I/O package that helps the user to perform all the input-output operations. These streams support all the types of objects, data-types, characters, files etc to fully execute the I/O operations.</p>

    <p>Before exploring various input and output streams lets look at 3 standard or default streams that Java has to provide which are also most common in use:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>System.in: This is the standard input stream that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.</li>
        <li>System.out: This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.Here is a list of the various print functions that we use to output statements:

            <ul>
                <li>print(): This method in Java is used to display a text on the console. This text is passed as the parameter to this method in the form of String. This method prints the text on the console and the cursor remains at the end of the text at the console. The next printing takes place from just here.</li>
                <li>println(): This method in Java is also used to display a text on the console. It prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console. The next printing takes place from the next line.</li>
                <li>printf(): This is the easiest of all methods as this is similar to printf in C. Note that System.out.print() and System.out.println() take a single argument, but printf() may take multiple arguments. This is used to format the output in Java.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>System.err: This is the standard error stream that is used to output all the error data that a program might throw, on a computer screen or any standard output device <br/> This stream also uses all the 3 above-mentioned functions to output the error data: 
        <ul>
            <li>print()</li>
            <li>println()</li>
            <li>printf()</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
