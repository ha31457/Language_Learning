    <h1 style="color: white; font-size: 35px;"> What is C++ ?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white;"> C++ is a middle-level programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. In the early 1980s, Bell Labs was an enhancement of the C language to provide support for OOPs (Object Oriented Programming Systems) and additional features. </p>

    <h1 style="color: white; font-size: 35px;"> Why to Learn C++ Programming </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">Here in this section, we have listed some points to teach you why C++ is important and why you should learn this programming language as a coder : </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">C++ supports the principles of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">C++ is an appropriate programming language for systems programming and performance-critical applications. Basically, C programming supports low-level memory manipulation and direct hardware access.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">The STL, or Standard Template Library, in C++, provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms, which helps simplify and accelerate software development.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">Although C++ is well known for supporting OOP, it also supports procedural and generic programming. This implies that you can write code in a variety of ways, depending on the requirements of your project.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">Developers have the freedom to create their own abstractions thanks to C++â€™s support for the creation of customized data types and operators.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">The ability to write and compile C++ code to run on different platforms makes it a flexible language for creating cross-platform applications.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">It is widely used in many different fields, such as systems programming, game development, embedded systems, and more. C++ has a sizable and vibrant user community.</li>
    </ul>    
    <h1 style="color: white; font-size: 35px;"> Uses of C++ Programming </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: white;">Like other programming languages, C++ is also a widely used programming language, and here in this section, we are going to discuss the areas where C++ is used.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;"> <b>Application and Software Development</b> - C++ programming language is widely used in software development. Here are some of the most popular programs developed using C++ like Adobe Photoshop, Thunderbird, MySQL and the backend of Spotify is also developed using C++. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;"> <b> Operating System Development </b> - C++ is also used to develop major operating systems, like Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows. Apart from OS, C++ is also used to develop major web browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Chrome.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px; color: white;"> <b> Development of Games Engines </b> - C++ is executing so fast hence, it is also used to develop gaming engines like Cube, Cry Engine 3.6, Cry Engine 4, 4A Engine, and many more.</li>
    </ul>
